man pages navigation: 

If you are reading a very long page, and you need to switch back and forth between a few 
sections, use marks. Let us say, I am at a certain position of the man page. To mark the
position, I press m and followed by some key, say 1. Now, the position is saved at mark 1. 
If I scroll somewhere else and I need to revisit this position, I simple press a followed 
by 1.
